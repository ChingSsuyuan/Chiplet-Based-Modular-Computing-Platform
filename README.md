The Chiplet-Based Modular Computing Platform aims to develop a flexible, scalable, and high-performance computing solution utilizing chiplet technology. 

# Sprint 1
We read the article and confirmed our research direction on chiplet technology. We completed the product mission statement, MVP, and user story related to it.

# Sprint 2
After further research on chiplet technology, we have focused on the packaging technologies related to chiplets, specifically MCM (Multi-Chip Module), CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate), and EMIB (Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge). We completed a PowerPoint presentation and shared findings in class.
# Sprint 3
We analyze the development of chips from the perspective of packaging technology to explore and develop the Chiplet-Based Modular Computing Platform.

First, we researched the evolution and history of packaging technologies, progressing from 2D to 2.5D and then to 3D.

Focusing on the current leading packaging technologies, we explored and studied the performance of Multi-Chip Modules (MCM) and CoWoS, analyzing their transmission rates, compatibility, and scalabilit.
