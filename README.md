The Chiplet-Based Modular Computing Platform aims to develop a flexible, scalable, and high-performance computing solution utilizing chiplet technology. 

# Sprint 1
We read the article and confirmed our research direction on chiplet technology. We completed the product mission statement, MVP, and user story related to it.

# Sprint 2
After further research on chiplet technology, we focused on the packaging technologies related to chiplets, specifically MCM (Multi-Chip Module), CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate), and EMIB (Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge). We completed a PowerPoint presentation and shared findings in class.

# Sprint 3
We analyze the development of chips from the perspective of packaging technology to explore and develop the Chiplet-Based Modular Computing Platform.

## First, we researched the evolution and history of packaging technologies, progressing from 2D to 2.5D and then to 3D.

## Then, Focusing on the current leading packaging technologies, we explored and studied the performance of Multi-Chip Modules (MCM) and CoWoS, analyzing their transmission rates, compatibility, and scalabilit.

# Future Plan
Commit a research report on chiplets focused on package technology. 
Use visualization techniques to test the performance of different chip packaging technologies
